# DefenseNetworkDesign

<!-- Introduction -->
### Introduction
Networking is referred as connecting computers electronically for the purpose of sharing information. For the very purpose of sharing information we need to build a secured network
with which transfer of information becomes reliable.Defence network is for the securing of military and government computer systems. Like everyone else in the world, national agencies
also have to secure their systems against malicious cyber attacks. Hence we have decided to
build a design for Defense Network which consist of two functional areas naming Central Command (Headquarters) and Base Camp network. In this project we are establishing a secured
communication between both these functional areas.
### Objectives
Build a compatible wireless and wired solutions for use in the required environment. Securing
headquarters offices and the base camp offices with the required firewalls, access control lists,
and special privileges.

### Network Requirements
* Firewall(Security) : A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and
outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a
defined set of security rules.
* Routers(Connectivity): A router receives and sends data on computer networks. Routers
are sometimes confused with network hubs, modems, or network switches. However,
routers can combine the functions of these components, and connect with these devices,
to improve Internet access or help create business networks.
* End Devices: The network devices that people are most familiar with are called end
devices, or hosts. These devices form the interface between users and the underlying
communication network.
* Main Server: A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve
data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the
Internet. Many types of servers exist, including web servers, mail servers, and file servers.
* ACL’s: An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules that is usually used to filter network
traffic. ACLs can be configured on network devices with packet filtering capabilities, such
as routers and firewalls.
* Wireless Access Points: Wireless access point (WAP), or more generally just access point
(AP), is a networking hardware device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a
wired network.
*  Virtual LAN A VLAN (virtual LAN) is a subnetwork which can group together collections of devices on separate physical local area networks (LANs). A LAN is a group of
computers and devices that share a communications line or wireless link to a server within
the same geographical area.
* Secured Communication etc
### Major Design Areas and Functional Areas
* DESIGN AREA:
1. Central Command Designing (HEADQUARTERS)
2. Base Camp Designing
3. Internal LAN Designing
4. Network Distribution
* FUNCTIONAL AREA:
1. Central Command
2. Internal and External secured communication using ACL’s defined using firewalls
3. Base Camp offices
4. Internal working and communication in the camp
5. External access and communication with the central command.

### Summary
In this project we have achieved the main objective of this network which is to provide secure
communication to the Central Command Offices and Base Camp Offices and vice a versa. It
is designed to be functionally and physically isolated from access by people not employed by
the military organization so as to minimize the risk of unauthorized use. We have used many
networking concepts to make it an impactful and wise network in the working state.
